# Default-_checker
In modern day’s credit card plays an important role in every person’s daily activity. Customer purchases their needs with their credit cards and online transitions. Banks and financial institutes consider denying the credit applications of customers to avoid the risk of defaulters. Credit risk is the rise of debt on the customer who fails to make the billing payment for some period. The purpose of the project is how to reduce the defaulters among the list of customers, and make a background check on whether to provide the loan or not and to find the promising customers. These predictive models would benefit the lending institutions and to the customers as it would make them more aware of their potential defaulting rate. The problem is a binary classification problem whether a customer will be defaulting to pay next month payment. The dataset is unbalanced so the focus was on the precision and recall more than the accuracy metrics. After comparison with precision-recall curve, logistic regression is the best model based on the False Negative value of confusion metrics. Moreover, after changing the threshold value of the logistic regression, GUI (Graphical user interface) implemented and predicted whether a customer is defaulter or not-defaulter.
